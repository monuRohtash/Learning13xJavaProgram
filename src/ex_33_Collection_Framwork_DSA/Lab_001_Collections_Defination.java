    /**
     âœ… What is Collection in Java?
     In Java, a Collection is an object that stores a group of elements â€” like a container for multiple data items.

     It's part of the Java Collection Framework (java.util package), which provides ready-made classes and interfaces to store,
     retrieve, and manipulate data easily.

     ðŸ“¦ Why Collections?
     Arrays have fixed size.
     Collections are dynamic â€” they grow/shrink as needed.
     They offer powerful methods for sorting, searching, filtering, etc.

     âœ… Types of Collections in Java
     Java Collection Framework mainly has 3 categories:

     Collection (Interface)
     â”œâ”€â”€ List       â†’ Ordered, allows duplicates
     â”œâ”€â”€ Set        â†’ Unordered, unique elements only
     â””â”€â”€ Queue      â†’ Follows FIFO (First-In, First-Out)
     */
